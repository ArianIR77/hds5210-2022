# Feedback on Final

I think this was a great final project.  You laid out a clear goal up front, provided useful data, and your code was easy to follow.

The only thing I could have used more of is explanation along the way.  You had a good introduction and some conclusions, but your steps along the way weren't explained in as much detail as I would have like.  More details on each step to explain "why" a certain data transformation is necessary and where it is going lead next.
